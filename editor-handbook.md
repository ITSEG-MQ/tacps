## Principles of Editing
Please place resuable resources in ```./assets```, and single-use resources in the related directory.


## How to Edit
As the webpages for the website are explicitly seperated into different directories, 
editors just need to edit the corresponding file within the dedicated directory.
For example, if the editor would like to edit program webpage, then the file needs to be amended 
is ```./program/index.html```.

Meanwhile, please check with maintainer if anything related to structure needs to be amended.

The website is still in construction, thus the layout might be imperfect, we are continously working on this to provide a better version.

## Local Testing

This is a TL;DR from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

1. First install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Open terminal and switch working directory to this repo.
3. use ```jekyll serve --baseurl=""``` to start the local deployment, 
then visit [127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) to check the <span style="color:red">real-time</span> deployment.

As the local one is updating in real-time, you can edit,save and refresh the webpage to check the result.

## Website Deployment
Currently we are deploying a 2-stage website deployment:
1. [itseg-mq.github.io/tacps](https://itseg-mq.github.io/tacps)  for staging, hosted by GitHub Pages
2. [tacps.org](https://tacps.org) for production, self-hosted (online very soon, ETA 3 days)

GitHub Pages can provide a quick look on the result, while the self-hosted one has Cloudflare caching for faster access around the world. 

The automated deployment to production is almost done, before that please only check the first one to see the result.
