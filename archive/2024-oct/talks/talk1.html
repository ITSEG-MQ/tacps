<h2 style="line-height:1.3;">How Safe Will I Be Given What I See? Visual Prediction of Calibrated Safety Chances with (Foundation) World Models</h2>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Baruah</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  In safety-critical autonomous systems, safety prediction traditionally relies on low-dimensional data with specific physical meanings, such as poses and velocities. However, such data is not always available, which leaves only high-dimensional sensor observations, such as images from cameras or LiDAR scans, and makes safety prediction increasingly challenging. This talk reports on the recent techniques for using high-dimensional observation data for safety prediction; at the heart of these techniques is the notion of a world model, which can predict future observations without meaningful low-dimensional data. We present several world models implemented with neural representation learning as well as foundation models for image segmentation and natural language prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel uncertainty quantification technique that combines confidence calibration with conformal prediction.
