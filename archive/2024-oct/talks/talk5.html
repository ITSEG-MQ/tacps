<h2 style="line-height:1.3;">Engineering safe autonomous systems: achievements and challenges</h2>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Elena Troubitsyna</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  Autonomous systems such as self-driving cars, drones, various servo-robots are intended to operate without human intervention over prolonged time periods, perceive their operating environment, adapt to changes while pursuing the defined goals or generating the new ones. Both perception and planning rely on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Often autonomous systems implement safety-critical functions, which might cause immediate or indirect safety hazards. However, ensuring safety of systems that employ AI and ML-based components is an open engineering challenge. In this talk, I will discuss some advances in ensuring safe autonomy as well as point out open research challenges.
