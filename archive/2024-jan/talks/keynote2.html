<h2 style="line-height:1.3;">Information Leakage in Cyber-Physical Systems</h2>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Tevfik Bultan</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  A crucial problem in computer security is detecting information leakage via side channels. Information gained by observing non-functional properties of cyber-physical systems can enable attackers to infer private and sensitive information accessed by the system. For example, observations about execution time, memory usage, or timing and sizes of network packets can all leak sensitive information. In this talk, I will discuss techniques for detecting and quantifying information leakage. I will also discuss how an adversary can use observations about system behaviors to construct input sequences that recover secret information. Finally, I will discuss mitigation techniques for preventing information leakage.
