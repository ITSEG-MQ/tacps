<h2 style="line-height:1.3;">Verify-then-Monitor: Calibration Guarantees for Safety Confidence</h2>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Oleg Sokolsky</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  An emerging assurance paradigm for autonomous systems relies on the combination of design-time verification and run-time monitoring in order to establish and maintain our confidence in the system operation. It is important to ensure that design-time and run-time assurance efforts are complementary, to avoid gaps in assurance, as well as minimize duplication of effort. This talk will consider different ways to combine formal design-time verification with rigorously specified monitoring. We will discuss safety assurance guarantees that can be derived in each case and the role monitor calibration plays in establishing mathematically grounded probabilistic treatment of verification results.
