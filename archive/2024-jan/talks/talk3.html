<h2 style="line-height:1.3;">Controlling the information flow of autonomous systems</h2>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Mustafa O. Karabag</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  Autonomous cyber-physical systems operate in information-scarce environments with other cooperative or adversarial agents. To succeed in these environments, these systems must actively control the information that they receive, process, and generate. In this talk, I will talk about how autonomous systems can control the information flow surrounding them by concealing sensitive information for security and privacy, detaching from unnecessary information for robustness against model or data inaccuracies, and conveying information for efficient cooperation. In particular, I will discuss the design of multiagent systems that are robust to communication losses, the design of deceptive and counter-deceptive policies for autonomous systems, and the design of inferable policies for efficient cooperation.
